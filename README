ABOUT

apache-vsl is a logging program, intended to be run from Apache.  It is 
designed to be configurable, versatile, efficient and scalable.

INSTALLATION

apache-vsl requires Perl 5.6.0 or newer.  apache-vsl requires several 
Perl modules, most of which are in a standard Perl installation (though 
your distribution may split Perl into "base" and "standard" packages).  
Additionally, apache-vsl requires the Config::General module, which may 
be installed from CPAN or your distribution.

To "build" and install apache-vsl:

  make
  make test
  make install
  make clean

/usr/local is the default Makefile prefix, use PREFIX to override.

USAGE

Please see the man page for full details.
